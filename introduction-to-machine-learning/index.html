  <p>Since the emergence of AlphaGo, AlphaFold2, and ChatGPT etc., artificial intelligence technologies (including machine learning) have revolutionalized today&rsquo;s paradigm of scientific research. However, little is known about the principles of the tech itself by people outside of CS areas. This blog is to briefly introduce these concepts.</p>
<p>Before diving into the fancy/mysterious words, we must first understand what <strong>learning</strong> is in human beings.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-learning-in-humans">What is learning in humans?</h2>
<p>Gain of knowledge from experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>experience ➡️ learning ➡️ knowledge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a baby wants to learn the concept of color, he/she needs to &ldquo;observe&rdquo; many colorful things.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Apple is red;</li>
<li>Banana is yellow;</li>
<li>Mango is yellow;</li>
<li>Blood is red.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The baby then <strong>learns</strong> how to differentiate red and yellow. Then he/she is given a test.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s the color of a rose?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This knowledge of color is then &ldquo;applied&rdquo; in other situations.</p>
<p>This is an example of learning from experiences.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-machine-learning">What is machine learning?</h2>
<p>A type of &ldquo;<strong>learning</strong>&rdquo; without being explicitly programmed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>data ➡️ machine learning ➡️ computer models</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a machine is set to develop a model predicting whether or not a patient has cancer, the machine also requires to &ldquo;observe&rdquo; many data.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>78-year-old man with 30 years history of smoking has cancer.</li>
<li>67-year-old woman with weight dropping 10kg within a month has cancer.</li>
<li>30-year-old man coughing frequently in the past 2 weeks didn&rsquo;t have cancer.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A machine learning algorithm <strong>learns</strong> that one with old age, rapid weight dropping, and long history of smoking may have cancer. Then the algorithm also needs to be tested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What about a 50-year-old woman started coughing frequently in the past month with TB history?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This knowledge of predicting cancer is then &ldquo;applied&rdquo; to test whether it is successfully &ldquo;learned&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is an example of learning from data.</p>
<p>In this process, we don&rsquo;t explicitly give specific instructions on how to identify cancer patients.</p>
<h3 id="machine-learning-algorithms-vs-rule-based-algorithms">Machine learning algorithms vs Rule-based algorithms</h3>
<ul>
<li>ML algorithms: No specific instruction is given.</li>
<li>Rule-based algorithms: <code>if</code>, <code>then</code>, <code>else</code> &hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="three-types-of-ml">Three types of ML</h2>
<h3 id="supervised-learning">Supervised learning</h3>
<p>Requires <strong>labeled</strong> datasets for training</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g., Differentiate between apple and pear</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised learning</h3>
<p><strong>No labels</strong>, discovering clusters</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g., Identify subsets from data</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement learning</h3>
<p>Trained from <strong>feedbacks</strong> to perform a task</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g., AlphaGo trained to play chess</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="artificial-intelligence-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning">Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI &ndash; machine with human intelligence features (i.e., do things only human can do)</li>
<li>ML &ndash; learn from data</li>
<li>Deep Learning &ndash; a type of ML algorithms mimicing neural networks</li>
</ul>
