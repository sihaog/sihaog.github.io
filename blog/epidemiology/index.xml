      <description>Epidemiology has been defined as “the study of the distribution and determinants of disease frequency”.
As definition implies, the study of epidemiology contains two major components:
Description of data Causal analysis Descriptive epidemiology The first part of Epidemiology is to study the distribution of disease, or more simply put, is to describe disease data.
Distribution = describing the pattern of an illness in terms of person, place, and time.
Person: Who has disease (Demographic characteristics: age, sex, ethnicity, etc) Place: Is this disease equally spatially distributed?</description>
