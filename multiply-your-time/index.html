  <p>I just watched an interesting TED Talk on &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2X7c9TUQJ8">How to Multiply Your Time</a>&rdquo; because I&rsquo;ve been struggling with time management and procrastination these days.</p>
<p>Important ideas came from this video:</p>
<h2 id="significance-calculation">Significance Calculation</h2>
<p>Multiply your time means do <strong>significance calculation</strong>. Time management is not a <em><strong>logical</strong></em> thing to do, but an <em><strong>emotional</strong></em> thing to deal with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You <strong>MULTIPLY</strong> your time by giving yourself the <strong>EMOTIONAL PERMISSION</strong> to spend time on things <strong>TODAY</strong> that will give you more time <strong>TOMORROW</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That reminds me of my early days at primary and secondary school, when I always got a lot of homework to do especially when it comes to weekends and holidays. I really hated these long holidays because the homework created a really huge burden for me.</p>
<p>Initially, I, like many of my classmates, always procrastinate on my homework. It was one Friday night when it surprisingly came to my mind that if I could just finish my homework however late that night, I would be really happy and enjoy the following weekend holiday, without stress, completely free. So, I got all my homework done that night, and have been doing that ever since. And yes, I gained and enjoyed freedom.</p>
<p>Now after watching that YouTube video, I finally realize that, the feeling throughout my Friday nights was an <em><strong>emotional advantage</strong></em>. I succeeded in multiplying my time on the weekends, by forcing myself spending the Friday nights on my homework.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true. Time management is an emotional thing.</p>
<h2 id="the-focus-funnel">The FOCUS Funnel</h2>
<p>Another point of that YouTube video is about the Focus Funnel, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Focus-Funnel.png" alt="Focus Funnel"></p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminating (Saying No to) things you don&rsquo;t have to do.</li>
<li>Automating the task you need to do.</li>
<li>Delegating the tasks you need to do, by teaching others. (So that you will free yourself up.)</li>
</ol>
<p>If the idea of significance calculation is to change our perspective, the Focus Funnel gives me a useful guide on exactly how to deal with tasks today.</p>
